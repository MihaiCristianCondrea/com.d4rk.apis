    "question": "Why do you use analytics and ads at all?",
    "answer": "<p>Independent development involves recurring costs: domain renewals, build tooling, Firebase quotas, music licensing, and a growing fleet of test devices. Anonymous analytics and respectful advertising make it possible to keep the apps free while still covering those expenses.</p><p>Metrics such as screen load time, crash frequency, and feature usage help me prioritize fixes and improvements. Ads are placed sparingly and follow Google’s content policies so they remain as unobtrusive as possible.</p>",
