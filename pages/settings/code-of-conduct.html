    <h1>API Console code of conduct</h1>
    <p>

    <h2>Working together</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Treat contributors with respect. Feedback should be constructive and
        focus on improving the API output, not the person.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use inclusive language across comments, issues, and commit messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid sharing sensitive data in sample payloads. Use placeholder values
        when demonstrating schemas.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section class="policy-section">
    <h2>Change review principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Validate generated JSON through the provided builders before committing
        files to <code>main</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reference documentation links in the PR description when changing
        schemas or introducing new content types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep history clear by using descriptive commit messages and avoiding
        force-pushes on shared branches.
      </li>
